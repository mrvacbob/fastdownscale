The initial work for an efficient thumbnailing library.

Requires libjpeg-6. Newer versions won't compile because the API
changed.

moe/ includes a reference implementation used in danbooru, which
is much better than imagemagick and co, but is still inefficient
and doesn't take advantage of many features of JPEG files.

=======================================
Theory
=======================================

* JPEGs can be decoded 8 pixel rows at a time.
  PNG can be decoded 1 row at a time.
  So you don't need to allocate the other rows.
* JPEG->JPEG thumbnailing should be done in planar YUV
  space, not RGB space.
* When resizing JPEGs 1/8 the size, we can skip the IDCT
  entirely. For progressize JPEG, we can skip reading past
  the first scan.
* When resizing 1/2 to 1/4 the size, we can use lowres IDCT.
* Resampling kernels are separable, so the horizontal and vertical
  scaling can be done in separate passes. This means the horizontal
  scaling pass only needs to run on one row at a time, so the rest
  don't need to be allocated (except to save work in decoding stages).
* Resampling images should be done with fixed-point math.
* Vertical scaling is easy to do in SIMD.

=======================================
Problems
=======================================

* Everything
* Resizing down to about 75% produces strange undersampling artifacts
  (it looks like a nearest-neighbor resize). It's probably fast enough
  these days to use a better resampling kernel anyway.
* Doesn't compile with libjpeg-8
* No PNG support
* No GIF support
* No WebP support(?)
* Written in C++
* libjpeg is extremely inefficient; opening any file involves malloc()+bzero()
  of very large arrays. I wrote a patch to use calloc() and then lost it.
  Even with calloc() the thumbnailer died in my Linux VM on some large images.
  Can't remember if it was virtual or physical memory exhaustion, which would be
  important to know.
* resample.cpp is crazy and should be rewritten. However, it's still less
  crazy than everyone else's attempts at writing resampling code. In particular,
  it uses 1D passes (good) and it's short (good) but uses floating point (bad).

=======================================
To experiment with
=======================================

* libavcodec for image decoding. It will use (much) more memory,
  since it allocates the entire image beforehand, but is much faster.
* swscale for resizing
* libjpeg-turbo
